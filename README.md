# Installation

```
gh extension install rawnly/gh-targetprocess
```

# Configure

The first time you run the extension you will be prompted for 2 properties:

- **BASE URL**
  You can insert your targetprocess url (eg `<your-company>.tpondemand.com`)
- **TOKEN**
  You can generate an access token on your profile

# Usage

Just run the extension with the optional argument of the ID.

If your branch has the ID in the name, it'll be derived.

```
gh targetprocess [ticket-id or url]
```
